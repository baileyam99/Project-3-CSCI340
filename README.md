<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a an assignment for CSCI 340: Operating Systems with Dr. Ralph Crosby. We had about 3 weeks to complete the project with a partner. This project is a custom-made shell using GO. The shell will execute `cd {directory}`, `ls`, and `exit` as built in functions. The shell will pass all other commands to the main terminal and return the intened output. The program will also run commands from a text file.

Run this command in a terminal: > `go run project3.go` 

* Type a command in the shell for it to be executed parallel commands must be seperated by '&'

* Program uses a loop to print out the shell prompt, wait for input, and execute the command(s) entered by the user. 

* Program will exit if the exit command is entered by the user.

* One .txt file included for batch command testing.
